## Simple Pig Game

This is a simple web version of the Pig game which was first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. Pig is a simple dice game in which, each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold". The first player to score 100 points wins the game.
